# Assistive Aim-Guide üéØ

**Assistive Aim-Guide** is a real-time **auto-aiming assist tool** designed specifically to help gamers with **physical disabilities**. It leverages AI models, real-time camera integration, and automated mouse movements to optimize target acquisition and gameplay precision.

---

## üìã Features

- **Auto-Aim Integration**: Automates precise aiming to reduce physical strain, helping people with physical disabilities (motor skills).
- **Customizable Masking**: Mask parts of the screen to minimize distractions.
- **Multi-Model Support**: Compatible with **PyTorch** & **ONNX** models only.
- **Dynamic CPS Logging**: Logs and monitors corrections per second (CPS).
- **Visual Feedback**: Optional display of target processing and visuals.
- **Enhanced BetterCam**: Optimized screen capture for smooth performance.
- **Headshot Mode**: Enables slight upward adjustments for better accuracy.
- **Accessibility Focus**: Reduces motor strain for individuals with physical challenges.
- **Arduino Leonardo** - Integrates with Arduino for additional customization and hardware-based controls for physical challenges.

## üõ† Requirements

Ensure you have **Python 3.11.6** installed.

### Installation via `requirements.txt`:
Run the following command to install all required libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ How to Download and Run

1. Download the Project Files:

- Visit the project page on GitHub:
https://github.com/YourUsername/Assistive-Aim-Guide

- Click on the green "`Code`" button.
- Select "`Download ZIP`".
- Extract the downloaded `ZIP` file to a folder on your computer.
   - prefer to your `Desktop`

2. **Install Python 3.11.6**:

- Download `Python 3.11.6` from the official website:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3116/

- During installation, check "`Add Python to PATH`".

3. **Install Dependencies**: Open a terminal or command prompt in the extracted folder and run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Configure the Tool**:

- Open the `config.py` file in a text editor.

- Customize settings such as model path, device type, and activation keys

```
# Portion of screen to be captured (This forms a square/rectangle around the center of the screen)
screenShotHeight = 320
screenShotWidth = 320

# Use "left" or "right" for the mask side depending on where the interfering object is, useful for 3rd player models or large guns
useMask = True
maskSide = "left"
maskWidth = 110
maskHeight = 230

# Autoaim mouse movement amplifier
aaMovementAmp = 1.1

# Person Class Confidence
confidence = 0.75

# Key to quit and shut down the autoaim
aaQuitKey = "8"

# Key to toggle the autoaim
aaActivateKey = "CapsLock"

# If you want to aim slightly upwards towards the head
headshot_mode = True

# Displays the Corrections per second in the terminal
cpsDisplay = False

# Set to True if you want visuals (frame display)
visuals = False

# Smarter selection of people (targets close to the center of the screen)
centerOfScreen = True

# Choose your model configuration here:
# model_path = 'v5.engine'  # For TensorRT engine model
# model_path = 'v5.onnx'    # For ONNX model (ONNXRuntime)
model_path = 'v5.pt'        # For PyTorch model

# Device can be 'cpu' or 'cuda' (for GPU)
device = 'cpu'

# Use FP16 for faster inference on supported GPUs
# Note: Not relevant for CPU or ONNX models, set to False
fp16 = False
```

5. **Run the Application**: 
- Launch the tool using the following command:

```
python main.py
```

## üì∏ How It Works

1. **Camera Initialization**:
- `Utilizes BetterCam for real-time screen capture with adjustable FPS`.

2. **AI Model Inference**:
-  `Processes frames using the AI model`.
- `Filters detections based on confidence thresholds`.

3. **Mouse Automation**:
- `Automatically adjusts the mouse cursor to aim at detected targets`.
- `Reduces physical effort for players`.

4. **Accessibility**:
- `Designed to assist individuals with motor challenges`.
- `Helps improve accuracy and reduce physical strain during gaming`.
