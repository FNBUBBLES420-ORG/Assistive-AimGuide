----

### 3. Configure settings:
Open the `config.py` file and adjust the following settings according to your preferences:

- **screenShotHeight** and **screenShotWidth:** Define the portion of the screen to be captured around the center.
- **useMask, maskSide, maskWidth, and maskHeight:** Set these to mask parts of the screen where a model or object might interfere (useful in third-person games or for large weapons).
- **aaMovementAmp:** Controls how smooth the aim is. Adjust based on your preference and game type.
- **aaQuitKey:** Default is `8`, press this key to quit and shut down the auto-aim.
- **aaActivateKey** = `CapsLock`, press to toggle the autoaim
- **confidence:** Adjust detection confidence level for the target (default is `0.4`).
- **headshot_mode:** Set to `True` to aim slightly upwards towards the head.
- **cpsDisplay:** Set to `True` if you want to display corrections per second in the terminal (for debugging purposes).
- **visuals:** Set to `True` to display what the bot "sees" (bounding boxes, etc.).
- **centerOfScreen:** Prioritize targets near the center of the screen for smarter target selection.
- **onnxChoice:** Choose between `2` (AMD for nvidia), or `3` (NVIDIA) when using ONNX models.
- **model_path:** Uncomment the correct path based on whether you're using a TensorRT engine or ONNX model.
  - Use `v5.engine` for TensorRT.
  - Use `v5.onnx` for ONNX.
- **device:** Set to `'cpu'` or `'cuda'` depending on whether you're running on CPU or GPU.
- **fp16:** Set to `True` to use FP16 for faster inference on supported GPUs.

## Usage Instructions

### Activation
- **Start/Stop**: Use the `Caps Lock` key to toggle the bot on and off based on your game settings.

### Adjustments
- **Aim Adjustment**: The bot automatically detects targets and prioritizes those near the center of the screen. It adjusts the aim smoothly. Adjust aim behavior through `aaMovementAmp` and other settings in `config.py`.
- **Speed Values for Aim Adjustment**:
  - Slow: 0.2 - 0.4
  - Medium: 0.5 - 0.7
  - Fast: 0.8 - 1.0
  - Very Fast: 1.1 - 1.5+

### Special Modes
- **Headshot Mode**: Enable this mode to make the bot aim slightly upwards to target heads by setting `headshot_mode` to True.

### Quitting
- **Exit**: Press the '8' key to stop and exit the bot.

## üîß Configuration Options
Modify settings in the `config.py` file to customize bot behavior:
- **Auto Aim Movement**: Change the `aaMovementAmp` value to control how smoothly the bot adjusts aim.
- **Headshot Mode**: Toggle headshot prioritization with `headshot_mode`.
- **Screen Resolution**: Adjust the aim area using `screenShotWidth` and `screenShotHeight`.
- **Masking**: Configure `useMask`, `maskSide`, `maskWidth`, and `maskHeight` to ignore certain screen areas.
- **Quit Key**: Set `aaQuitKey` to customize the key used to quit the bot (default is 8).
- **Activation Key**: Use Caps Lock to toggle the bot on/off.
- **Confidence Level**: Adjust the target detection confidence using the `confidence` setting.
- **Visual Feedback**: Enable visual overlays with `visuals` to see what the bot detects.
- **Center Targeting**: Use `centerOfScreen` to prioritize center-screen targets.
- **ONNX Provider**: Choose between AMD or NVIDIA execution with `onnxChoice`.
- **Model Path**: Specify the model file path in `model_path`, supporting `.engine` or `.onnx`.
- **Device**: Set execution to 'cpu' or 'cuda' with `device`.
- **FP16 Mode**: Enable `fp16` for faster processing on compatible GPUs.
