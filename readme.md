üö® **Note:** If this step doesn‚Äôt work, double-check that the `.whl` file matches your Python version (e.g., `cp311` is for Python 3.11). Just locate the correct `.whl` file in the `python` folder and replace the path accordingly.

## 10. Set Your Environment Variables üåé
Add the following paths to your environment variables:
- `system path`
```
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\lib
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\libnvvp
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin
```

# Setting Up CUDA 11.8 with cuDNN on Windows

Once you have CUDA 11.8 installed and cuDNN properly configured, you need to set up your environment via `cmd.exe` to ensure that the system uses the correct version of CUDA (especially if multiple CUDA versions are installed).

## Steps to Set Up CUDA 11.8 Using `cmd.exe`

### 1. Set the CUDA Path in `cmd.exe`

You need to add the CUDA 11.8 binaries to the environment variables in the current `cmd.exe` session.

Open `cmd.exe` and run the following commands:
- DO each one `Separately`
```
set PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin;%PATH%
set PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\libnvvp;%PATH%
set PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\extras\CUPTI\lib64;%PATH%
```
These commands add the CUDA 11.8 binary, lib, and CUPTI paths to your system's current session. Adjust the paths as necessary depending on your installation directory.

2. Verify the CUDA Version
After setting the paths, you can verify that your system is using CUDA 11.8 by running:
```
nvcc --version
```
This should display the details of CUDA 11.8. If it shows a different version, check the paths and ensure the proper version is set.

3. **Set the Environment Variables for a Persistent Session**
If you want to ensure CUDA 11.8 is used every time you open `cmd.exe`, you can add these paths to your system environment variables permanently:

1. Open `Control Panel` -> `System` -> `Advanced System Settings`.
Click on `Environment Variables`.
Under `System variables`, select `Path` and click `Edit`.
Add the following entries at the top of the list:
```
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\libnvvp
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\extras\CUPTI\lib64
```
This ensures that CUDA 11.8 is prioritized when running CUDA applications, even on systems with multiple CUDA versions.

4. **Set CUDA Environment Variables for cuDNN**
If you're using cuDNN, ensure the `cudnn64_8.dll` is also in your system path:
```
set PATH=C:\tools\cuda\bin;%PATH%
```
This should properly set up CUDA 11.8 to be used for your projects via `cmd.exe`.

#### Additional Information
- Ensure that your GPU drivers are up to date.
- You can check CUDA compatibility with other software (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow) by referring to their documentation for specific versions supported by CUDA 11.8.
